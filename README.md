# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios Landing Page Solution

This is my solution to the **Loopstudios Landing Page** challenge on Frontend Mentor. This project focuses on building a fully responsive landing page with clean layout structure, interactive UI states, and a mobile navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The challenge was a great opportunity to practice semantic HTML, modern CSS architecture, responsive design techniques, and DOM manipulation without relying on frameworks or external libraries.

## Overview
This project is a responsive marketing landing page for a fictional VR company called Loopstudios. It adapts seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, providing an optimal layout for each screen size.

The page includes a hero section with overlay effects, an interactive mobile navigation menu, a featured content section, a responsive grid of creations, and a structured footer with navigation and social links.

All layout styling is handled with modern CSS techniques, and the mobile menu interaction is implemented using vanilla JavaScript.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size.
- Experience a mobile-first responsive design.
- Open and close the mobile navigation menu.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
- Navigate through content using keyboard focus.
- View different layouts for mobile and desktop versions.
- See smooth visual transitions and overlay effects.
- Experience clear typography hierarchy and structured spacing.

## My process
- Structured the layout using **semantic HTML5** elements such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer`.
- Followed a **mobile-first approach**, progressively enhancing the layout using media queries.
- Built layouts primarily using **Flexbox** for alignment, spacing, and responsiveness.
- Used **CSS custom properties (variables)** to create a small design system for colors.
- Applied the **BEM naming convention** to maintain modular, scalable, and readable CSS.
- Created overlay effects using **pseudo-elements (`::before`)** for hero and card interactions.
- Implemented hover and focus states to improve usability and accessibility.
- Used **positioning and z-index layering** to manage stacked content and overlays.
- Developed the mobile navigation toggle using **vanilla JavaScript**.
- Managed UI states by dynamically adding and removing CSS classes.
- Organized the project structure cleanly for maintainability.
